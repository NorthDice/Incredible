# 🌐 Responsive Website Project

## Overview  
This website was developed based on a high-fidelity design prototype created in **Figma**, using **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal was to deliver a fully responsive and maintainable layout that accurately reflects the design and adapts smoothly to various screen sizes.

## 🔧 Key Features  
- **Component-Based Styling**  
  CSS styles were organized by components, improving code readability, modularity, and reusability. Each UI section (e.g., header, footer, cards, navbar) is isolated, making it easier to manage and extend.

- **Responsive Design**  
  The layout was made responsive using media queries and flex/grid layouts, ensuring the site looks great on:
  - 💻 **Desktop (1024px)**  
  - 📱 **Tablet (768px)**  
  - 📲 **Mobile (480px)**  
  This guarantees consistent user experience across all common devices.

- **Scalable Architecture**  
  The project’s CSS structure supports easy customization and future scaling, allowing smooth integration of new features or redesigns.
